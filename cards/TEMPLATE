setup() {
  # Setup of the handler script. This is entirely optional and can be anything
  # you need to make the script work, including creating temporary files, and
  # setting up variables used by the main loop, such as $SERIAL_DEV and
  # $CHAT_TIMEOUT, in case you want to use the `modemchat` helper function.
  # You could also set these variables outside the function.
  #
  # Failure is fatal and will cause wwan-helper to exit with an error.

init() {
  # Steps required to initialise the modem to the point where it's ready to
  # take commands. This might involve turning it on.
  #
  # The function must block until the modem is ready.

unlock() {
  # Steps required to unlock the SIM. It will only be called if a SIM PIN is
  # specified in the configuration.
  #
  # The function must block until the SIM is accessible.
  #
  # Be careful to avoid repeatedly sending a PIN as that might yield the SIM
  # card to lock itself.

  # Failure is fatal and will cause wwan-helper to exit with an error.

  # works with NDIS carrier setups (no PPP chat).
  #
  # The function must block until the carrier is connected.

  # Failure is fatal and will cause wwan-helper to retry, unless the user
  # didn't configure retires, in which case it will cause wwan-helper to exit
  # with an error.

  # can just call those functionsâ€¦)
  #
  # The function must block until the card is ready to get registered with the
  # network.

  # Failure is fatal and will cause wwan-helper to retry, unless the user
  # didn't configure retires, in which case it will cause wwan-helper to exit
  # with an error.

  # the send-receive unit and/or putting the card into a power-safe mode.

  # The script must block until the card is shut-down.
  #
  # Failure is *not* fatal and in case of an error, wwan-helper will just
  # finish and pretend the world is all in order.

  # Optional steps to tear-down the handler script, e.g. removing temporary
  # files, etc.
